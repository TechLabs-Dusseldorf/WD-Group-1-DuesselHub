## MVP

### Who is this for?​

Citizens in Düsseldorf who want a simple way to report local
public issues (e.g., broken streetlights, potholes, trash) and
see if others are affected.​

### What single problem are we solving?​

Issue reporting is fragmented and opaque, so people don’t
know if something was already reported or whether it’s being
addressed.​

### What is the ONE thing the user must be able to do?​

Submit an issue and immediately see it publicly listed so
others can confirm/endorse it.​


## Must Haves MVP:
1. Report an issue (form): 
Title, description, location, and an optional photo upload.
2. Public issue feed: 
List of all active reports in a basic detail view.
3. Endorsement (upvote): 
Users can “endorse” a report; endorsement count visible to everyone.
