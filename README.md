# WD-Group-1-DuesselHub

## MVP

### Who is this for?​

Citizens in Düsseldorf who want a simple way to report local
public issues (e.g., broken streetlights, potholes, trash) and
see if others are affected.​

### What single problem are we solving?​

Issue reporting is fragmented and opaque, so people don’t
know if something was already reported or whether it’s being
addressed.​

### What is the ONE thing the user must be able to do?​

Submit an issue and immediately see it publicly listed so
others can confirm/endorse it.​


## Must Haves MVP:
1. Report an issue (form): 
Title, description, location, and an optional photo upload.
2. Public issue feed: 
List of all active reports in a basic detail view.
3. Endorsement (upvote): 
Users can “endorse” a report; endorsement count visible to everyone.

## Nice-to-have Features (in no particular order)
1. Authentication
Users can create an account and log in. Reporting issues and endorsing (voting) is restricted to authenticated users.
2. Map View
Reports are displayed as pins on an interactive map to improve discovery by location and area.
3. Status Updates
Introduce status labels such as “In Progress” and “Fixed” to provide transparency and close the feedback loop.
4. Neighbourhood Alerts
Notify users about newly reported issues in their area or important local announcements.
5. De-duplication During Submission
Suggest similar nearby reports while submitting a new issue to reduce duplicates.
6. Filters & Search
Enable filtering and sorting of reports by category, status, date, and keyword.
7. Auto-Moderation
Implement basic spam and toxic-content detection with flagging mechanisms to maintain content
8. Comments
Allow users to post short comments or updates on an issue to add context and track progress.
9. Subscribe to an Issue
Users can follow an issue and receive notifications when it is updated or marked as fixed.
10. Multi-Language Support
Provide the UI in multiple languages (e.g., DE/EN) to improve accessibility and inclusivity.
